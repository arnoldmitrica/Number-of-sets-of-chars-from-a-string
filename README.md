# Number-of-sets-of-chars-from-a-string
How many sets of chars can be taken out from a string?

For example if you have the string: APPLE, this translates to ["A","P"."P","L","E"].
So for these given inputs:
(BAAPXXOLPLE, APPENOPLEGXAPLB, QWERTYUIO)
BAAPXXOLPLE -> BAPXXOL -> should return 1
APPENOPLEGXAPLB -> APLENOPGXB -> NOGXB -> should return 2
QWERTYUIO -> should return 0
